# Cameras & Imaging

## Video Imaging
Video cameras onboard the sub will primarily be used for navigation and obstacle detection. However, they maintain a secondary purpose of recording each underwater excursion. 

### Requirements
Numbered by importance:
1. Cost - I’m bankrolling this thing myself!
2. FPS - As out primary method of obstacle detection and navigation, anything more than 60 FPS suffices.
2. Latency - The higher the latency, the more of delay on which the sub operates.
3. Controls - It should have manual controls for every setting, but also great auto-controls. This way, I don;t need to fiddle with camera setting control software at the start, but can later.
4. FOV - The larger the field of view, the more the sub sees. Duh.
4. Resolution - Bigger is better for the most part, as long as the camera supports region grabbing. Otherwise, keep in mind that we’ll need to process every pixel at some point in the chain of sub operations.
5. Interface - One wire for power and data is ideal. I choose USB 3 over ethernet because I’m afraid to add network latency.
6. Size/Weight - The smaller and lighter, the better. 
7. Temperature - Most cameras will operate within the NYC oceans temperature range (~0C to ~25C)

#### Nice to haves
- Onboard recording
- Waterproofing

## Still Imaging
Any still imaging devices onboard will only operate as high definition frame grabbers for scenes of interest (or merely intermittently). 

### Requirements
Numbered by importance:
1. Cost - Again, my money.
2. Controls - Same as with video imaging.
3. Resolution - More.
4. Size/Weight - Once again, the smaller and lighter, the better.
5. Temperature - Most cameras will operate within the NYC oceans temperature range (~0C to ~25C)
