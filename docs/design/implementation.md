# Implementation Plan
The electrical and mechanical sections are subject to wild change, as I’m an expert in neither.

## Milestones
The goal is to be in the water for a first ocean test during Summer 2016. Timelines change often, but here’s a rough one.

- 15Aug2015 - Begin
- 08Sep2015 - First meetup. Might just be two of us!
- 15Oct2015 - 
- 15Nov2015 - Have purchased one of each sensor and computing device.
- 15Dec2015 - Decide on final hull & ballast system design. Sensors interfaced.
- 15Feb2015 - 
- 15Mar2015 - 
- 15Apr2015 -
- 15May2015 -
- 15Jun2015 - Maiden voyage?

## Purchase schedule
1. Main computer & accessories
2. 1 thruster
3. 1 thruster control boards
4. 1 camera
5. Batteries
6. Hull & remaining duplicates of above components


## Software

1. Basic infrastructure and development mechanisms (GitHub, Vagrant, ROS)
2. Install OS and development mechanisms onto main computer board
3. Sensor interfaces
4. Logging & playback utilities (requires one of each device)
5. Low level navigation
6. Obstacle detection
7. High level 

## Electrical
I want to avoid any board design unless absolutely necessary. In my experience, board design usually yields errors along the way. Also, having OTC components allows others to easily reproduce the robot.

1. + Choose batteries
2. Power computing components with batteries
3. Choose thruster control boards
3. Wire thrusters to thruster control boards
4. Wire thruster servos to servo control board
5. 

## Mechanical
1. + Choose batteries
2. Design hull w/ballast system (I envision the two as very tightly coupled)
3. Design thruster servo attachment
4. Design video camera servo attachment
5. Design battery housing
6. Construct hull
7. Construct servo attachments
