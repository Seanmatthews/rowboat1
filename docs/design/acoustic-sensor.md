\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Acoustic sensor array\
\
## Why?\
Since the primary purpose of the AUV is to dive down to the bottom, scout and take video in a local area, and then resurface, I am reimagining the INS. With an acoustic sensor array fitted to the AUV, and a locator beacon affixed to a floating device at the surface, the AUV could constantly correct its position relative to the locator beacon. \
\
Because we care more about the AUV finding its way back to us\'97 moreso than a global position\'97 we can use the acoustic sensor array in lieu of a DVL or FOG IMU. However, one drawback is that our logs will not contain GIS coordinates for identifying the location of video taken. We can easily overcome this obstacle by attaching a GPS to the floating locator beacon-bob mechanism.\
\
## What\
We want a molded hydrophone, perhaps around
