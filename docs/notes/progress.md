# Progress Notes

## 27Sep15
Purchased an OpenROV IMU with which to experiment. The IMU has decent specs in the low-to-mid range (~$100-$200), and I’m attracted to the fact that it’s already used in underwater ROV applications. The IMU has an I2C connection, which the ODroid C1+ supports, but the IMU does not come with a standard connection. While the IMU is open-sourced, the software interface is not documented. However, OpenROV keeps all their provided software here: https://github.com/OpenROV
